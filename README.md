🎮 Snake-Water-Gun Game Welcome to the classic Snake-Water-Gun game, now reimagined in Python! This timeless game is a playful twist on the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, where players and the computer engage in a fun-filled battle of wit and chance. With snakes slithering, water splashing, and guns blazing, who will emerge victorious?
🐍 Game Rules:
Snake (🟢) drinks Water (💧) – Snake wins!
Water (💧) extinguishes Gunpowder (🔫) – Water wins!
Gun (🔫) shoots Snake (🟢) – Gun wins!
If both you and the computer choose the same option, it's a draw!
🧠 How It Works:
The user selects their move: 's' for Snake, 'w' for Water, or 'g' for Gun.
The computer makes a random choice.
The game then compares the choices to determine the winner or if it's a draw.
Results are instantly displayed, letting you know if you outsmarted the computer or if it’s time for a rematch!
